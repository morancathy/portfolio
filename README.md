# Cathy Moran's Portfolio
## Purpose/ Over all to-do's
I want HR manager to see I have basic experience and can grow within the organization because I put a lot of time and commitment into my work. Willing to learn and grow, as this is my new career.

I want a mid-level engineer to look at my code and see it is easy to read, organized and not confusing. When it is confusing, I should include short explanation of what that block of code does.

I will write a short blurb about each project. Describing what it does and why, so that a friend can understand what I do as a developer and what I created.

## Projects (in no particular order...yet)
**Destination Unknown (projet 3)**
Questions about the MERN Stack and improvements needed to my project?

Relational Databases:
- Still unable to connect the dots between 2 databases. I need to be able to update and delete comments in both modules.
- If I want to edit or delete a comment, this form pops up for all the comments. I only want it to pop up for the one specific comment. I believe this has something to do with me not referencing it correctly.
- Currently I am using an if statement to display comments related to it's specific destination. I feel there is a better/concise way.
- On each destination's show page, I only want to display up to 2 commits, then have a 'more' button for the rest. I did this, but am not targeting the commits array correctly, mainly because I'm using the weird if statement.


Map/if/for loops in the return statement:
- What are the exact rules? When can I use what?

React Context or useReducer:
- I need to clean up my props and need to fully understand options to pass state to grandparent/siblings.

Third Party API:
- I need to create a default for when a user types in a city that the API does not have. Currently, it throws an error but user doesn't know what is going on. Need to figure out how to catch that error and when it happens, display a statement saying "option not found." I don't know how to do this.

- Need to fix api call from https to https

General Questions about MERN stack:
  - Honestly, I couldnâ€™t explain what Client side rendering is vs server side rendering.  
  - When to use controlled forms vs uncontrolled forms.

More updates needed to this project:
  - format the data/timestamp
  - scroll to appropriate place when form pops up
  - add 'Add Destination' to the Nav bar
  - Have a default image in the instance when user adds destination but doesn't have image.

      maybe's
        - scrolling back button/link?
